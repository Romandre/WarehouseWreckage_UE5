# WarehouseWreckage UE5 game repository

### WarehouseWreckage game was built in Unreal Engine 5 using the blueprint editor. 

During the development process I learned:
- blueprint classes, instances and fuctions 
- scene creation grounds and level building
- importing and using assets
- basics of how physics work in UE5 and how to use it on the actors
- how to spawn and manipulate actors (projectiles) at the game's runtime
- how to aim and shoot considering player's position and rotation tracking the amount of ammo
- collision meshes editing
- how to reload a level on certain event
<br />

#### The game was developed in scope of [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) on Udemy.
