### WarehouseWreckage game was built in Unreal Engine 5 using the blueprint editor. 

The game is about causing chaos by shooting the projectiles to surrounding objects in abandoned warehouse. It was creatied in order to get familiar with UE5 physics and collisions nuanses.

During the development process I learned:
- blueprint classes, instances and fuctions 
- scene creation grounds and level building
- importing and using assets
- basics of how physics work in UE5 and how to use it on the actors
- how to spawn and manipulate actors (projectiles) at the game's runtime
- how to aim and shoot considering player's position and rotation tracking the amount of ammo
- collision meshes editing
- how to reload a level on certain event
